A decentralized **ticketing smart contract** built on the **Celo Sepolia testnet**, designed to enable secure, transparent, and tamper-proof event ticket management.

---

## 🧩 Project Description

**Ticket.sol** is a Solidity-based smart contract that allows event organizers to issue, manage, and verify event tickets on the blockchain.  
Each ticket is represented as a token and recorded immutably, preventing counterfeiting or duplication.  

The goal is to bring **trust and transparency** to ticket distribution while giving event-goers verifiable ownership of their tickets.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Allows **event organizers** to create and sell tickets directly via the blockchain.  
- Enables **buyers** to purchase, transfer, and verify ticket authenticity.  
- Maintains a **public ledger** of all ticket ownership and transactions.  
- Eliminates intermediaries and fraud through **smart contract automation**.

---

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ Secure and tamper-proof ticket issuance  
- 🔁 Ticket resale and transfer supported  
- 💎 On-chain verification of authenticity  
- 🧾 Transparent event records  
- 🪙 Built on the **Celo Sepolia Testnet** for speed and low cost  
- 🧠 Written entirely in **Solidity 0.8.x**
